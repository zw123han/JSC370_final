### Understanding Gender Bias in Self-Reported Software Compensation Data

#### Description
This is the final project for the JSC370 - Data Science II course at the University of Toronto. The goal is to apply data science skills on a topic of interest. 

My project focuses on exploring gender bias in compensation in the software industry, using self-reported data from a publicly available version of the levels.fyi database.

#### Website
The following website contains interactive visualizations and descriptions of the project.

#### Acknowledgements
The data from this project is sourced from levels.fyi. Some analysis code has been adapted from labs prepared by the JSC370 teaching team.
